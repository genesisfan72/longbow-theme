This is a theme I started with Michael Wong (@mizko on Twitter) in 2015. Intended to be the sequel to our Broadsword theme, Longbow featured a full e-commerce suite powered by WooCommerce, along with several front page layout options.

The theme was built on the underscore starter theme, and I actually made it pretty far with this one before priorities switched.  If I remember correctly I have all of the front page variants complete, the post and page layouts done, with only the various ecommerce pages left to do.

The code is offered up in an as-is state and is in need of some tidying up.  Still, it should serve as a decent starting point for anyone wishing to pick up where I left off.
